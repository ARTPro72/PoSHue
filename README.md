# PoSHue
Basic PowerShell to control Philips Hue Luminaires using the REST API of the Hue Bridge.

## Why?
I have Philips Hue Luminaires and I wanted a way of controlling them using PowerShell.

## What will happen in the future?
I am likely to turn this in to a PowerShell class. At Day 1, this is nothing more than a simple method of generating the JSON and sending it to the Bridge. I've got a bit to learn about PowerShell classes before I make it anything useful but that's the plan. Control isn't likely to extend much beyond HSB, on and off though so don't expect miracles with schedules etc.
